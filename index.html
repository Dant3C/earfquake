        <h1>About Earthquake Data</h1>
        <p>The data used is from the CORGIS Dataset Project. This dataset contains information about earthquakes from 7/27/2016 to 8/25/2016
        <br> Some of the information contained in this datasets includes information about the significance of the earthquake. This value is determined on a number of different factors 
        such as, magnitude, maximum MMI, felt reports, and estimated impact. The Modified Mercalli Intensity (MMI) Scale is a scale that is used to measure the intensity of an earthquake by taking into account the way the earthquake is felt by people and the damage that is visible on the surface.  </p>
